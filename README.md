**Expanding Cards Project**
This is a simple project that demonstrates the creation of expanding cards using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The expanding cards provide an interactive way to showcase multiple items or images in a card-like format. When a card is clicked, it expands to reveal more information or a larger version of the image.

**Project Structure**
The project consists of the following files and directories:

**index.html:** This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the expanding cards.
**styles.css:** This CSS file contains the styles for the expanding cards, including the layout, colors, and animations.
**app.js:** The JavaScript file handles the interactivity of the expanding cards, including the click event listeners and toggling the expand/collapse functionality.

**Getting Started**
To use or contribute to this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yash-bharadwaj/expanding-cards.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd expanding-cards
Open the project files in a code editor of your choice.
Usage
To use the expanding cards, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. You will see a series of cards displayed on the screen. Clicking on a card will expand it, revealing additional information or a larger image. Clicking on another card will collapse the previously expanded card and expand the newly clicked one.


**Acknowledgements**

This project was inspired by the concept of expanding cards and is a simple implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created as a learning exercise and can serve as a starting point for more complex projects involving interactivity and animations.
